      <h1 class="text-extrabold text-4xl mb-4">The Toe Nurse LLC Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="mb-4"><em>Last updated July 28, 2024.</em></p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Preliminary statement</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The Toe Nurse LLC (sometimes referred to in this policy as "we" or "us") maintains its online
        presence and provides services to customers and users via its website at <a href="https://www.thetoenurse.com">https://www.thetoenurse.com</a>
        ("Website"). The Website's primary purpose is to market the services provided by The Toe Nurse LLC. One of the
        most important issues that any company must address is that of its customers' and users' privacy. We believe
        that our privacy policy adheres to all relevant laws, regulations, and customs while at the same time is readily
        accessible and understandable. We take great pride in the trust that you place in us and our Website. For our
        Website to be effective, we must collect certain information from you. If you do not agree with any of the terms
        or practices described in this privacy policy, please do not access our Website or applications. Through the use
        of our Website, you are consenting to the provisions set forth in this privacy policy.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. If you want to make sure
        you are up to date with our privacy policy, we advise you to visit this page frequently.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">What does our privacy policy cover?</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">This privacy policy covers our treatment of your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined
        below) that we may collect when you access our Website or any application. This privacy policy does not apply to
        the practices of any company that we do not control or own, people that we do not employ or directly manage, or
        third-party websites that we do not own, control, or manage. If you visit a website that we mention or link to,
        be sure to review that website's privacy policy.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Our policy allows us to collect information from you in a manner that will allow you to retain
        control over your personal information, but still allow us to make your online visit to our Website safe,
        satisfying, and rewarding. We use your information to make it easier for you to access information and services
        provided on our Website. The information allows us to provide you with a personalized experience. Use of any of
        the services on our Website is entirely voluntary; however, if you do not provide the Personally Identifiable
        Information if requested by us, then we may elect not to make the related services available for your use.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Information we collect</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">There are two types of general information that are typically collected online: Anonymous
        Information and Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Anonymous Information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific person. While we may
        have a hit counter on a page on our Website, that counter only tracks the number of hits, it does not collect
        any specific information about our visitors. This is an example of Anonymous Information.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Personally Identifiable Information is information that tells us about you and may include the
        following:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-8">
        <li>Email address</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">and similar information that helps identify you. This information is needed to allow us to
        personalize your experience on our Website. When we request Personally Identifiable Information from you, we may
        include a link to these privacy policies and inform you what information is required and what information is
        optional.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We may collect information from you directly in several ways such as when you place an order,
        become a member, maintain a "wish list," complete a survey, or enter a contest. We collect information if you
        contact us.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We may collect information about you from third parties so we can provide better, more
        personalized content and services for you, such as our service and marketing partners, with whom we might
        co-brand, promote, or engage in joint marketing activities.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">How we use your information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We use your information to improve your experience on our Website. We may use the information
        to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-8">
        <li>Process the transactions you request of us, such as to register an account, process orders and credit card
          transactions, or cash in your rewards
        </li>
        <li>Create and manage accounts</li>
        <li>Respond to your requests for help, comments, or concerns about our Website</li>
        <li>Notify you if we materially update our privacy policy or terms of use.</li>
        <li>Conduct market research, manage our promotions, or tell you about our products, services, or special offers
          on our own products or third-party products we think you might find interesting
        </li>
        <li>Improve our products and services, by combining information that we have collected offline, online, from
          third-party sites, and from devices to help us understand and improve our Website
        </li>
        <li>Protect against fraud and for security purposes</li>
        <li>Comply with legal or regulatory requirements</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Users who are children and their parents</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Our Website does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from and about
        children. We are sensitive to the issues involved in collecting such information from children and have taken
        steps to ensure the privacy of any minors accessing our Website. If it is determined that such information has
        been inadvertently collected, we will take the steps necessary to ensure that such information is deleted from
        our database or that verifiable parental consent is obtained. Our Website established guidelines that operate in
        connection with our adherence to the Federal Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA): <a
            href="http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm">http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm</a>. We strongly agree with the
        intent of COPPA and have structured our COPPA policy to enable us to collect only the information from children
        that is necessary for their access to our Website service; and, then only after obtaining verifiable consent
        from their parents.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">We strongly recommend that any information about children submitted to our Website be of the type
        that would typically appear in a local newspaper. Accordingly, information that is not appropriate for local
        newspapers should not be posted to our Website.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Information we share</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We will not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your Personally Identifiable Information to anyone
        except as provided in this privacy policy. However, we may send Personally Identifiable Information about our
        users to other companies or people when:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-8">
        <li>we need to share your Personally Identifiable Information to provide a product or service that you
          requested;
        </li>
        <li>we need to send the Personally Identifiable Information to third parties that provide services on our behalf
          to provide you with a product or service you requested;
        </li>
        <li>we use marketing partners to help us audit the quality and effectiveness of advertisements, provide analytic
          services, and similar services;
        </li>
        <li>we use third parties (such as Google and/or Facebook) to collect and analyze information about the use of
          our Website. This information helps us provide relevant advertisements to you and measure the effectiveness of
          our marketing campaigns;
        </li>
        <li>we use third-party shipping and credit card processing partners to enable them to properly fulfill your
          product and service requests. Our partners are not permitted to retain, share, store, or use this Personally
          Identifiable Information for any secondary or other purposes not directly related to the fulfillment of your
          product and service requests;
        </li>
        <li>we have your consent to share your Personally Identifiable Information;</li>
        <li>we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes or take other steps to remain in compliance with
          applicable laws; or
        </li>
        <li>we find that your actions on our Website violate our Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines for our
          services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">In most respects, you will deal directly with our third-party advertisers and their shipping and
        credit card processing partners. Therefore, our users should carefully review our advertisers' privacy policies
        and terms and conditions prior to entering into a transaction with such advertisers.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Cookies</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We collect information about you through online tracking. We use, as do third-party service
        providers,
        tracking technology like browser cookies, web beacons and pixels on our Website, applications, and in
        emails we send to you. Cookies are pieces of data stored on hard drives that contain information about
        you and your activity. Web beacons and pixels help us understand how you interact with our Website.
        Cookies are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information while users are on our Website. Cookies
        may allow you to only log into the Website once while remembering your username and password for
        future access. Cookies may be rejected by you, but the rejection may result in more limited access to
        the services we provide since our services may be personalized to you. Cookies may also be used to
        allow access to sweepstakes, contests and other events. Some of our advertisers utilize cookies;
        however, we do not have control over or access to their cookies. We use cookies to monitor Website
        activity, not user activity. If you choose not to accept cookies, you should be aware that you may not be
        able to experience the full functionality of our Website.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Our Website does not recognize "Do Not Track" browser signals.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Links</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Our Website contains links to other websites. Some of these websites may display our product logos, our
        products, or other content provided by us. Please understand that we are not responsible for the privacy
        practices of these other websites. We recommend that you be aware when you leave our Website and that you read
        the privacy policies of the other websites to see how they treat information they collect. By providing access
        to third-party websites or advertisements, we are not endorsing the products or services provided by the owners
        or operators of such websites. Consequently, we will not be responsible for the accuracy, relevancy,
        availability, reliability, copyright compliance, legality or decency of the material contained in such
        third-party websites linked to our Website. We strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel is
        necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction. This privacy policy applies
        only to the information collected by us via our Website.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Security</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We take our commitment to protect your information seriously. When you submit sensitive information to our
        Website, the information is protected both online and offline.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When our registration and order forms request you to enter sensitive information (credit card or social security
        numbers), the information is encrypted and is protected with SSL technology.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Even though we use SSL encryption technology to protect your sensitive information online, we also employ
        internal procedures to protect sensitive information offline. Access to all of our users' sensitive information
        is restricted to only those employees that require access. We instruct our employees during the course of their
        tenure regarding protecting our users' confidential and sensitive information and we perform periodic checks of
        how the employees adhere to our policies. We maintain our servers in a secure and locked facility that restricts
        access to only those employees and technicians that require access. Our security policies are periodically
        reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Only authorized employees and technicians have access to the information
        provided by our users.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Due to the nature of technology, you are also partially responsible for the security of your information. Since
        people have become accustomed to the internet, browser technology has made it easier for everyone to return to
        their favorite websites without re-entering their usernames and passwords. While this is easier for surfing,
        when Personally Identifiable Information is associated with the log-in information, your security could be
        affected. We strongly recommend that you do not save your username and password in your browsers and that you
        either remember your log-in information or store your usernames and passwords separately to avoid unauthorized
        access to your information from your devices.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Additional information regarding our security practices can be obtained by emailing questions to <a
          href="mailto:privacy@thetoenurse.com">privacy@thetoenurse.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        We also offer the following advice:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside my-8">
        <li>If you share your device with other people, remember to log off our Website before leaving it.</li>
        <li>Don't share your password with anyone. If you store your log-in information in your computer, remember to
          password protect that information. No one from our Website will ever ask for your password.
        </li>
        <li>If asked, don't give out your personal information.</li>
        <li>If you are unsure about the information you are providing, ask us, another administrator, or another person
          before posting the information.
        </li>
        <li>If there is information that you would not like to see in your local newspaper, don't post it to our
          Website.
        </li>
        <li>When in doubt, ask us at <a href="mailto:privacy@thetoenurse.com">privacy@thetoenurse.com</a>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Announcements</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">As we add new services to our Website, we will inform our users of the additional features. We may
        also send announcements regarding updates to the service and information regarding maintenance. Since these
        messages contain important information regarding the service, our users are not permitted to opt out of
        receiving these messages.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Corrections to personal information</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or you wish to terminate your participation
        in our service, we will try to provide a way to correct, update, or remove your Personally Identifiable
        Information from our servers. These updates and removals can be initiated on our users' information pages by our
        Website administrator or by sending a message to <a href="mailto:privacy@thetoenurse.com">privacy@thetoenurse.com</a>.
        In extenuating circumstances, we can address these issues via telephone or regular U.S. Postal Service. Some
        information may remain on our servers including in our archived records after termination of an account.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Opting out</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We value your privacy and provide you with the ability to "opt out" of having your information
        used for purposes not directly related to our Website service and the purposes for which the information is
        requested. For instance, our registration form has a box that can be checked you to opt out of having their
        information used for marketing purposes or shared with third-party partners of our Website. If you previously
        accepted our promotional materials and no longer want to receive these messages, you may opt out of receiving
        additional messages by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the message, replying with "unsubscribe"
        in the subject line of the email, or by emailing us at <a href="mailto:privacy@thetoenurse.com">privacy@thetoenurse.com</a>.
        You may also return to your information page to edit the information regarding receiving messages and
        newsletters and choose the opt-out option. If any user information is being shared with third parties or
        collected by third parties, we provide prior notice to our users, in order to allow them to make an informed
        decision regarding allowing the information to be collected and proceeding with the third-party transaction or
        not.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Changes to our privacy policy</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will inform you of what information we collect, how
        we use the information, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose the information to third parties. If
        at any time we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the
        time the information was collected, we will notify you via an email. You will then have the opportunity to opt
        out of allowing us to use the information. Users that fail to respond to the change of policy message will not
        have their information utilized pursuant to the new policies since we will implement the policies for all
        information collected from the time of the change forward. We will use the information in accordance with the
        privacy policy under which it was collected.</p>

      <h2 class="text-extrabold text-3xl mb-4">Enforcement</h2>
